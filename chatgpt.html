        <h2><b><u>Background Information</u></b></h2>
        <p>ChatGpt is an artificial intelligence model that is developed by OpenAI. The company was founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and others. The first demo of ChatGpt was released on November 30th, 2022. 
            Their AI model is currently capable of answering most questions asked by users, although there are some limitations as to what it can answer and how it can answer. What's more is that the AI can ask follow up questions and challenge users' inquiries when deemed necessary. 
            The latest model that is free for public use is 3.5, but model 4 is available to those who pay for the plus subscription which is $20/month. Open AI aims to create AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) that is safe for all to use.

        <h2><b><u>Opinion</u></b></h2>
        <p>ChatGpt will definitely be one of the biggest artificial intelligence models used around the world. The AI has been growing extremely fast, and with the news talking about the threat of artificial intelligence, I think it is a good idea to mention ChatGpt as who know what its limits are or will be in future? Could this AI potentially have a mind of its own and decide to take over the world? Only God knows.
