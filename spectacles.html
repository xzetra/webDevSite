        <h2><b><u>Background Information</u></b></h2>
        <p> Spectacles, the smart glasses by Snapchat, were first released in 2016, with the second version releasing before the end of 2018. These versions allowed you to take pictures via the glasses and save them to your mobile device.
            The latest version, Spectacles 3, allow you to see augmented reality objects via the glasses. Snaps could also be taken via the glasses and sent to others. No further versions have been made after the 3rd version, most likely due to loss of interest in the product by the masses.

        <h2><b><u>Opinion</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            It seems like Snapchat has discontinued their Spectacle glasses. Nowadays, the hype seems to be surronding Rayban Stories Smart glasses. Perhaps Snapchat failed to take action on the buzz they had or did not marktet their product well enough.
            This is not the first time this has happened to a product, as it is not easy to keep the attention of the public on your product unless you know what you are doing.
