        <h2><b><u>Background Information</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            CRISPR is a gene-editing tool that is used to alter an individual's DNA. This technology was first invented in the late 1980s and has been improved on since.
            CRISPR has sucessfully treated patients with sickle-cell anemia, a genetic disease that alters blood cells in the body. As CRISPR continues to advance, more treatment options will become available and hopefully more accessible to the public.
            With advances in such a technology, more cures for various diseases will be developed.

        <h2><b><u>Costs</u></b></h2>
        <p>The costs for CRISPR therapy are currently very expensive, which will definitely need to be greatly cheaper before widespread use of this therapy becomes a reality.
            Current treatments range from $1 million to $3.5 million.

        <h2><b><u>Opinion</u></b></h2>
        <p>CRISPR has the potential to change the lives of many, especially those suffering from various genetic diseases like sickle cell. While this technology still has a long way to go, the promise is there, with therapies being created and advances being made everyday. One day, diseases like sickle cell will be able to be detected in a baby and edited out of their genes via CRISPR.
